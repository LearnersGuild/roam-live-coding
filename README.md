## Daily Log

### April 10 2018

- Get app setup and running
  - Add .env file
  - Run database setup commands
  - Run tests
  - Review what specific tests are running
- Talk through learning your way around an unfamiliar web application
  - Look in the `package.json` file to learn what tools/technology you're using (or whatever similar package manager-generated file exists depending on what language and framework you're working with, e.g. Gemfile for Ruby, mix.exs file for Elixir, etc)
  - Look for a "routes" or "router" file to see what pages and actions are available to the user
  - Look for a database schema file or a set of migrations (or both) to see what kinds of objects we're storing data on
- Discuss the degree to which this strategy for learning your way around apps should hold for various technologies (should be at least fairly similar across most MVC web apps)

### April 5 2018

  - Spend a long time figuring out what we forgot when wiring up redux-form
  - Complete SignUp component
    - but no form validation
  - Complete sign out action and reducer case

  - Still to do:
    - Use a HOC to protect components that require authentication (see Stephen Grider's advanced react Udemy course)
    - Allow login to persist even after refresh (ditto on Udemy course)
    - Create all the other views / functionality (great React/Redux practice!)

### April 4, 2018

  - Tomorrow: 
    - fix bug in signUpUser action where it's not sending data to server
    - form validation on signUp form

### April 3, 2018

  - Epic battle with `react-router`, `history`, `react-router-dom`, `redux-form`, semver.
  - Finally upgraded to latest version (4.x) of everything, and updated code accordingly. 
  - To do tomorrow: use Field component instead of <input> to take advantage of `redux-form` / use latest version of `redux-form` properly

### April 2, 2018

  - Review code that was hastily copied and pasted on Friday
  - Update SignIn component to display errors without using clarityui (including creating `error-alert` style)

  - Create `/auth/sign-in` route with passport local strategy middleware
  - Started the server, worked out some kinks with `dotenv`

### March 1, 2018

  - Complete tests for `getPostsByCityId`
  - Complete tests and functions for `getCityDataById`
  - Start writing express server (instantiate express)

### February 27, 2018

  - Fix `update*ById` tests so that `beforeEach` doesn't clobber `before`
  - Changed name of `getUserData` and `getPostById` to `getUserDataByEmail` and `getPostDataById` (respectively) for consistency
  - Started functions and tests for `getPostsByCityId

### February 23, 2018

  - Complete `updatePostById` function
  - Write tests and functions for `updateUserById`
  - Learn that mocha runs all the `beforeEach` functions *after* the `before` functions, which caused problems with our tests

### February 22, 2018

  - completed tests for `updatePostById` and *almost* finished function

### February 21, 2018

  - Completed `deletePostById` (including tests). 
  - Started to write `updatePostById` and tests

### February 16, 2018

  - Completed `getPostById` (including tests). 
  - Started to write `deletePostById` and tests

### February 15, 2018

  - Started going faster through back end looking to start react
  - Introduced async / await
  - Finished `getUserData`; started `getPostsByUserId`

### February 14, 2018 <3

  - Discovered that abstracted property tests function wasn't actually running the tests; un-refactored.
  - Created some tests for `getUserData` -- property set tests and values for some of the properties

### February 13, 2018

  - Discussed why Bonnie prefers one `expect` per test
  - Refactor property tests to make more DRY
  - Abstract out property tests into a function
    - now can be used in multiple tests
    - if we change to test in a different way it will affect all tests
  - Discussed integration vs. unit tests and stub/mock
  - Start to write tests and code for `getUserData`

### February 8, 2018

  - Discussed possible options for testing `getUserByEmail`:
    - Test for existence of each property individually
    - Create an object that represents all expected properties and values and do a "deep equal"
    - Create a set of properties, and a set of expected properties, and compare. 
  - Decided on (and coded) option 1

### February 6, 2018

#### Part I (9:15 - 10:00)
  - Researched `bcrypt` vs `bcryptjs`; decided on the latter
  - Completed `encryptPassword` and `comparePassword` functions in `password.js`
  - Added test to check that password was encrypted properly 
  - Discussed testing functions that return promises (and how easy it is to get false positives)

#### Part II (10:15 - 12:00)
  - harped on using JSDoc
  - Started to create getUserData, realized we needed getUserByEmail
  - refused to use chai includes despite Kelcey's best efforts
  - WIP: created tests for getUserByEmail
    - got stuck on comparing the object returned by the success case
    - will resume tomorrow by doing deepEqual using known userRow
      - this will involve giving user fixed "joined_at" data
      - export user data from db_reset so code is DRY and there's less chance for discrepancies
